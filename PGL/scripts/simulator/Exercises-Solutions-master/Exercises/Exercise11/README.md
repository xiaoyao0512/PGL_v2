Exercise 11 - Optimize matrix multiplication
============================================

Goal
----
* To understand portable performance in OpenCL.

Procedure
---------
* Optimize step by step ... saving intermediate versions and tracking performance improvements.
* After you've tried to optimize the program on your own, study the blocked solution optimized for NVIDIA GPU.
Apply these techniques to your own code to further optimize performance.
* As a final step, go back and make a single program that is adaptive so it delivers good results on both a CPU and a GPU.

Expected output
---------------
* A message confirming that the matrix multiplication is correct.
* Report the runtime and the MFLOPS.
