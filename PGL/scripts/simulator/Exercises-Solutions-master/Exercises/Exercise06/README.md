Exercise 6 - Matrix Multiplication
==================================

Goal
----
* To write your first complete OpenCL kernel **from scratch**
* To multiply a pair of matrices

Procedure
---------
* Start with the serial matrix multiplication program including the function to generate matrices (C/C++ only) and test results.
* Create a kernel to do the multiplication.
* Modify the provided OpenCL host program to use your kernel.
* Verify the results.

Expected output
---------------
* A message to standard output verifying that the chain of vector additions produced the correct results.
* Report the runtime and the MFLOPS.
