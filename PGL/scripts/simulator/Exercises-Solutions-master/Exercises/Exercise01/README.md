Exercise 1 - Platform Information
=================================

Goal
----
* Verify that you can run the OpenCL environment you'll be using in this tutorial.
Specifically, can you run a simple OpenCL program.

Procedure
---------
* Take the program we provide (`DeviceInfo`), inspect it in the editor of your choice, build the program and run it.

Expected output
---------------
* Information about the installed OpenCL platforms and devices visible to them.

Extension
---------
* Run the command `clinfo` which comes with the AMD implementation.
This outputs all the information the OpenCL runtime can find out about devices and platforms.
