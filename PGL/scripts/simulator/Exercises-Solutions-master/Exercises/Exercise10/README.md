Exercise 10 - Heterogeneous Computing
====================================

Goal
----
* To experiment with running kernels on multiple devices.

Procedure
---------
* Take one of your OpenCL programs.
* Investigate the Context constructors and include more than once device.
* Modify the program to run a kernel on multiple devices, each with different input data.
* Split your problem across multiple devices if you have time.
* Use the examples in the SDK to help you.

Expected output
---------------
* Output the results from both devices and see which runs faster.
