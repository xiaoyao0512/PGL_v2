Exercise 3 - Running the Vadd kernel (C++/Python)
=================================================

Goal
----
* To learn the C++ and/or Python interface to OpenCL's API

Procedure
---------
* Examine the C++ or Python program we provide you.
It will run a simple kernel to add two vectors together.
* Look at the host code and identify the API calls in the host code.
Note how some of the API calls in OpenCL map onto C++/Python constructs.
* Compare the original C version with the C++/Python versions
* Look at the simplicity of the common API calls

Expected output
---------------
* A message verifying that the vector addition completed successfully.
