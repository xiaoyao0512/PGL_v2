Exercise A - The vectorized Pi program
======================================

Goal
----
* To understand the vector instructions in the kernel programming language.

Procedure
---------
* Start with your best Pi program.
* Unroll the loop 4 times.
  Verify that the program still works.
* Use vector instructions in the body of the loop.

Expected output
---------------
* Output result plus an estimate of the error in the result.
* Report the runtime and compare the vectorized and scalar versions of the program.
* You could try running this on the CPU as well as the GPU...
