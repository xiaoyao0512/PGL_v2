Exercise 12 - Profiling OpenCL programs
=======================================

Goal
----
* To experiment with profiling tools.

Procedure
---------
* Take one of your OpenCL programs, such as matrix multiply.
* Run the program in the profiler and explore the results.
* Modify the program to improve the performance.
* Repeat with other programs if you have time.

Expected output
---------------
* Timing from the timer and profiling interfaces should roughly match.
